## Overview

VSet is based on the card game [*Set*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)).

## Cards

Each card is characterized by 4 properties

* Number: 1, 2, or 3
* Shape: Diamond, Oval, or Squiggle
* Shading: Solid, Striped, or Open
* Color: Green, Red, or Purple

The objective of the game is to find "sets". Sets are combinations of 3 cards where each of the 4 properties are either all the same or all different.
